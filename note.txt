-	C side calls function from lua...
-	lua yields...
	*	what if lua yeilds from a C function? the lua library doesn't know

	*	it panics, and instead runs the continue function.
-	what happens after the continue function? what does it return?
-	okay, turns out that was incorrect, and yields work fine. it was just the
	coroutine yielding which was odd.

each stage should have:
	-	the stage task calls a multitude of tasks within it:
		-	messages for the background
		-	subtasks to create
